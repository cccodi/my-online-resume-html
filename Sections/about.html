<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Clarisse — a creatively driven learner with a growing passion for web development, data analysis, and digital design. I love figuring things out, building projects from scratch, and combining creativity with logic to make something both useful and meaningful.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m focused on learning full-stack web development while also exploring tools like Excel, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy creating clean, responsive websites and analyzing data to tell clear, impactful stories.</p>
